## Explain the fundamental concepts of version control and why GitHub is a popular tool for managing versions of code. How does version control help in maintaining project integrity?
-Version control is a system that tracks changes over time ,allowing multiple people to collaborate on a project, revert to previous versions, and manage different branches of development.
Three types of version cotrol include Local version control,Centralised and distributed version control.
Local version Control tracks changes on a single machine, and it is not collaborative only works for smaller projects.
Centralised version contral has a centralised server which stores all the versions of a project .Users work with the same repository and commit to the same branch.
Distributed version control - Users access repository from any location allowing users to work from any base without being connected to the same netork.Every user has a copy of the repository and history on their local devices.

Github is a popular  control version tool because it is centraised colaborative tool which allows developers to collaborate encouraging collabortion,It is also easy to use and it provides robust documentation and support to programmers where one can get ideas from fellow programmers.It allows developers store their projects,

Version control helps maintain integrity of a project in the following ways:-
Tracks Changes – Keeps a history of all modifications, so nothing is lost.
Facilitates Collaboration – Multiple developers can work on different features without interfering with each other.
Enables Reversions – Rollback to previous stable versions in case of bugs or failures.
Supports Branching – Developers can work on separate features or fixes before merging into the main project.
Prevents Conflicts – Helps resolve conflicts when multiple developers edit the same file.
Ensures Code Integrity – Every commit is verified, reducing accidental overwrites or losses.

## Describe the process of setting up a new repository on GitHub. What are the key steps involved, and what are some of the important decisions you need to make during this process?
1.Sign in to your github account or create one if you dont have.
2.Create the new repository
  -navigate to the right corner and click + icon
  -Select ceate new repository
3.Configure repository setting.
  -This is where you will be prompted to fill in imortant details,
  -Give the name of the repository,briefly describe what your project is about but it is optonal,set the vsibility to either private or public , Then initialize repository with files such as READme,gitignore,
4.Create repository
  -Click "create repository to cpmplete the setup.
5.Clone repository to your local machine'
  -Open command prompt and enter the command "git clone  repository_URL "  repository_URL is the link to github repository created.
6.Add and push code to the repository.
  -cd repository_name -to navigate to the repository 
  - git add .  Adds new file t the repository
  - git commit -m "Initial commit" To perform changes on the repository.
  - git push origin main   Pushing the repository to github.
Important decisions to make include:
Repository Visibility – Decide if your repository should be public or private.
Branching Strategy – Decide whether you’ll use a main branch or set up develop and feature branches.
License Selection – If it's open-source, choose a license that suits your needs.
.gitignore Setup – Configure it to prevent unwanted files from being tracked.
Collaboration Settings – If working with a team, set up access permissions.


## Discuss the importance of the README file in a GitHub repository. What should be included in a well-written README, and how does it contribute to effective collaboration?
Since README File is used to provide a description of the projectit describes:
  -The purpose of the project
  -Provides instructions to users amd developers on how to navigate through it
  -Promotes collaboration as people will understand which part they can play in the project.
  -Makes the project look published and well maintained.

A well written README should include; Project title and a brief description of what the project does , Installation proces of the project , License ,Contact & SUpport.

A README contributes to effective collaboration in the following ways:-
-Clear setup instructions reduces confussionmaing quicker onboarding of teams
-Well documented repository will have reduced issues thereby reducing unnecessary questions.
-With cler instructions,README encourages more people to contribute and get invOlved in reporting issues and suggesting improvemens.

## Compare and contrast the differences between a public repository and a private repository on GitHub. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each, particularly in the context of collaborative projects?
A public reposiory is accessible to everyone while a private repoitory is only accessible to invited users.
A public repository i 

## Detail the steps involved in making your first commit to a GitHub repository. What are commits, and how do they help in tracking changes and managing different versions of your project?

## How does branching work in Git, and why is it an important feature for collaborative development on GitHub? Discuss the process of creating, using, and merging branches in a typical workflow.

## Explore the role of pull requests in the GitHub workflow. How do they facilitate code review and collaboration, and what are the typical steps involved in creating and merging a pull request?

## Discuss the concept of "forking" a repository on GitHub. How does forking differ from cloning, and what are some scenarios where forking would be particularly useful?

## Examine the importance of issues and project boards on GitHub. How can they be used to track bugs, manage tasks, and improve project organization? Provide examples of how these tools can enhance collaborative efforts.

## Reflect on common challenges and best practices associated with using GitHub for version control. What are some common pitfalls new users might encounter, and what strategies can be employed to overcome them and ensure smooth collaboration?
